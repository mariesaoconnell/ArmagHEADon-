## Areas of Improvement:

- Now that the JS is complete, I'd like to revisit a lot of the functions in the script.js file and <i>DRY</i> up the code. <br>

  Examples include:
  - Iterating through images on the <i>answer reaction</i> overlays
  - Further research on optimal screen menu switching (Between Start, Rules, Main Game, Questions, Answer Reactions, and Game Over)
  - Further research on optimal countdown functions
